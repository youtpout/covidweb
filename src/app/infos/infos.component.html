        bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your
        nose, coughing, or sneezing.
    </li>

        If soap and water are not readily available, use an
        alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60%
        alcohol.

        Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the
        trash.
